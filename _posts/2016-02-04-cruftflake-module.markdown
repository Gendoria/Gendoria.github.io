We are happy to announce a new module by Gendoria - [CruftFlake](http://github.gendoria.pl/cruftflake/).

This module began as a fork of [https://github.com/dvomedia/cruftflake](https://github.com/dvomedia/cruftflake).
But now it is a major rewrite, with proper travis and scrutinizer tests and preparations to add new functionality.

What, again, is a CruftFlake module? It provides developers with unique ID generator, similar to Twitter's SnowFlake.
If you try to build a distributed application and do not want to be bound to database generated IDs 
(these won't scale best, trust us), this module could be just for you.

We encourage you to go to [bundle page](http://github.gendoria.pl/cruftflake/) and test!
